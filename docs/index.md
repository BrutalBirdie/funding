# Introduction

Foundations and other organizations that have to distribute funding are faced with many administrative tasks and the need to interact with applicants and recipients in a specific workflow. The funding extension, together with other extensions and Drupal modules, provides a holistic solution for the entire funding process.

## Administrative tasks

The funding extension provides a precise and adaptable support for all administrative tasks that the giving organization has to perform. This includes receiving, checking and approving applications; viewing the history of applications; adding comments to applications (internally or visible for applicants); allocate funds; administer transfer contracts; receiving and checking proof of use.

## Web portal for applicants

The funding framework also provides a web portal which acts as interface for applicants. It allows applicants to submit applications, view ongoing application procedures, download transaction contracts, apply for disbursements and create where-used lists.

The web portal is a Drupal website, which allows organizations to enhance it with additional content such as an FAQ or information pages about funding opportunities.

## Adapt the funding framework to your needs

The funding extension has a modular structure. Additional to the existing configuration options within CiviCRM, the code provides many possibilities for developers to adapt it to a different funding workflow. This documentation currently doesn't mention all of these possibilities.

The current implementation reflects the workflow of _Arbeit und Leben_, a german organization that funded the development of this extension. In some places, you will need to adapt it to your own needs. For example, the current application form is in german and asks for data, that is probably not relevant in other contexts.

## We need your support

This CiviCRM extension is provided as Free and Open Source Software, and we are happy if you find it useful. However, we have put a lot of work into it (and continue to do so), much of it unpaid for. So if you benefit from our software, please consider making a financial contribution so we can continue to maintain and develop it further.

As part of the project, we have so far developed, enhanced or integrated the following extensions and modules (eventually not exhaustive):

- funding (CiviCRM extension)
- civiremote_funding (Drupal module)
- drupal-json_forms (Drupal modulel)
- Opis JSON Scheme + opis-json-schema-ext (PHP packages)
- Symfony ExpressionLanguage + expression-language-ext (PHP packages)
- external-file (CiviCRM extension)
- civiremote + cmrf + de.systopia.xcm + de.systopia.identitytracker (Tools for connecting Drupal portal environments with CiviCRM)
- de.systopia.civioffice (added new interfaces)

If you are willing to support us in developing this CiviCRM extension, please send an email to info@systopia.de to get an invoice or agree a different payment method. Thank you!
