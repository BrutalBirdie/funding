# Configuration

## Adapt the application form

The Drupal form that is shown when creating a new application needs to be different for every organization
and every funding program. It highly depends on the content of the funding program. The form that comes with the
funding framework is in German and reflects the specific needs of _Arbeit und Leben_, the organization that
funded the development of the funding framework.

Custom forms can be developed in additional CiviCRM extensions. If you need support in this, you can send an email to
info@systopia.de.

A form editor is planned, but not yet available at this moment.
