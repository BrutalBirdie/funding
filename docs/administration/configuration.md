## Adapt the application webform

The drupal webform that is shown when creating a new application needs to be different for every organization
and every funding program. It highly depends on the content of the funding program. The webform that comes with the
funding extension is in german and reflects the specific needs of _Arbeit und Leben_, the organization that
funded the development of the funding extension.

You can edit the form to your needs.

!!! question
    How would I edit the form? Where do I specify the fields that are present in the webform?
    Which fields are required?
