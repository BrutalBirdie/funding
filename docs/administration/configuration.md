# Configuration

## Adapt the application form

The Drupal form that is shown when creating a new application needs to be different for every organization
and every funding program. It highly depends on the content of the funding program.

The funding framework provides two kinds of applications: Normal Applications and Combined Applications. The two
corresponding application forms are in German and reflect the specific needs of _Arbeit und Leben_, the organization
that funded the development of the funding framework.

Custom forms can be developed in additional CiviCRM extensions. If you need support in this, you can send an email to
info@systopia.de.

A form editor is planned, but not yet available at this moment.

## Adapt the funding case types

The funding case types that are provided by the funding framework are

  * Sonstige Aktivit√§t (AVK1)
  * Internationale Jugendbegegnung
  * Sammelantrag Kurs

Again, they are specific to the needs of *Arbeit und Leben*. Suitable funding case types depend on the specific usage
of the organization that hosts CiviCRM.

Currently, there exists no administration page to change the funding case types. They have to be changed directly in the
code of the extension or in an additional CiviCRM extension. If you need support in this, you can send an email to info@systopia.de.
